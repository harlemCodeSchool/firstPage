<!--  THIS IS A COMMENT AND WILL NOT BE READ AS CODE
	WELCOME TO THE FIRST PAGE OF HARLEM CODE SCHOOL!
	AS YOU CAN SEE, THE TWO ARROWS AROUND THIS TEXT 
	WHAT MAKE ALL THE TEXT IN BETWEEN THEM COMMENTS. 

	MOST LANGUAGES HAVE THEIR OWN WAY TO COMMENT CODE, 
	SOME USE THE SAME SYNTAX. 

	ALSO, NOTICE THE <!DOCTYPE> TAG AT THE START OF THE 
	PAGE. THAT TAG IS ACTUALLY TELLING THE BROWSER THAT
	 'I AM USING THE DOCTYPE HTML 5'

	 OLDER DOCTYPES INCLUDED THE NUMBER OF THE LANGUAGE,
	 BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS NICE EASY ONE.
