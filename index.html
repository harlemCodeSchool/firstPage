<!--  THIS IS A COMMENT AND WILL NOT BE READ AS CODE
	WELCOME TO THE FIRST PAGE OF HARLEM CODE SCHOOL!
	AS YOU CAN SEE, THE TWO ARROWS AROUND THIS TEXT 
	WHAT MAKE ALL THE TEXT IN BETWEEN THEM COMMENTS. 

	MOST LANGUAGES HAVE THEIR OWN WAY TO COMMENT CODE, 
	SOME USE THE SAME SYNTAX. 

	THE <!DOCTYPE html> TAG TELLS THE BROWSER 'I AM USING THE DOCTYPE HTML 5'

	 OLDER DOCTYPES INCLUDED THE NUMBER OF THE LANGUAGE,
	 BUT NOW WE HAVE THIS NICE EASY ONE.

<!-- HTML pages have 3 parts, the doctype declaration, the 
Head section (everything between the <head> and </head> tags) 
and the body section, which is everything between 2 body tags. 

Nothing in the head tag gets rendered, rather it is used for information
that the browser needs, like to allow us to give the browser CSS
and Javascript pages that our HTML page needs to come to life. -->

		<h1>Core HTML</h1>
		<p>HTML is simple - its purpose is to shape the way you layout documents. </p>
	    <section>
		 <h3 class="hIndent">Common Tags</h3>
		 <p> Two of the most common HTML elements are divs and p (print) tags. Text that lies within 
		    print tags is displayed as normal text (AKA not 'bold' or underlined).
	        Div tags (some say they stand for 'divider') - are your basic separator tags. I think of them as boxes. 
	     <br> Here's some example of divs and their layout structure
	     <div>Div 1</div>
	     <div>Div 2</div>
	     <div>Div 3</div>
	     <div>Div 4</div>
